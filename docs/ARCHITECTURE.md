# Quantum Brainfuck Architecture

# UUID: 900100000003

## Overview
Quantum Brainfuck combines classical Brainfuck operations with quantum computing using Qiskit. This document outlines the architecture of the interpreter and its components.

## Components
- **Interpreter**: Handles the execution of Brainfuck commands and integrates quantum operations.
- **Quantum Operations**: Utilizes Qiskit to apply quantum gates and measure qubits.
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration for scalable deployments.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code for AWS resources.
